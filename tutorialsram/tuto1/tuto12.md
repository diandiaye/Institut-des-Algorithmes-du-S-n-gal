# Flow network

In graph theory, a flow network (also known as a transportation network) is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. The amount of flow on an edge cannot exceed the capacity of the edge.

A flow in a flow network is function f, that again assigns each edge e a non-negative integer value, namely the flow. The function has to fulfill the following two conditions:

The firste condition is that the flow of an edge cannot exceed the capacity.
