## Features

- Case 2: 
- Case 3: Remove an existing file in your repository
- Case 4: Get the remote changes onto your local machine while you are working on some other branch.

> Case 1 : Someone or your company started a new project and want you contributing to it. 
Once you become a collaborator in that project, you need to get the source code in order to start working. So what you have to do is go to the Git bash or Mac terminal, do :
```sh 
cd "name of folder"
```  
where "name of folder" is the name of the folder where you want to download the code. 
And the do :
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/V-Sher/medium_demo.git
```
