# Getting set up - finding a C compiler

The very first thing you need to do, before starting out in C, is to make sure that you have a compiler. The question that can be asked is what is a compiler ?
A compiler turns the program that you write into an executable that your computer can actually understand and run. If you're taking a course, you probably have one provided through your school.

If you haven't yet done so, go ahead and get a compiler set up--you'll need it for the rest of the tutorial. If you're on Windows, your best bet is to use Code::Blocks with MinGW. If you're on Linux, you can use gcc, and if you're on Mac OS X, you can use XCode.

# Introduction to C programming Langage

Every correct C program must include a function main in it's beginig. A function is a combination of different commands that do something.
To access the standard functions of C, you need to include a header with the #include directive. 

> #include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf( "I am alive!  Beware.\n" );
    getchar();
    return 0;
}

## Features

- Case 1 : Clone a git repository
- Case 2: 
- Case 3: Remove an existing file in your repository
- Case 4: Get the remote changes onto your local machine while you are working on some other branch.
- Case 5: Bring back a colleague’s file you messed up, back to its original form.



> Case 1 : Someone or your company started a new project and want you contributing to it. 
Once you become a collaborator in that project, you need to get the source code in order to start working. So what you have to do is go to the Git bash or Mac terminal, do :
```sh 
cd "name of folder"
```  
where "name of folder" is the name of the folder where you want to download the code. 
And the do :
```sh 
git clone https://github.com/V-Sher/medium_demo.git
```
